to-do:

- /book frontend route to fill pendencies (driver's licence) + confirm;
- select stock for update;
- tests for pricing calculations;
- a user can have only one booking on the same dates;

- write in here possible errors;
  - should stocks be directly mutaded? - maybe yes (in a more complex system) - regardless of the date, stocks mutations remain
- write in here what will be missing imo;
- write in here clarifications about the decisions;
