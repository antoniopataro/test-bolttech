to-do:

- tests for pricing calculations;
- avoid refetching when unnecessary // react query

- write in here possible errors;
  - should stocks be directly mutaded? - maybe yes (in a more complex system) - regardless of the date, stocks mutations remain
- write in here what will be missing imo;
- write in here clarifications about the decisions;
